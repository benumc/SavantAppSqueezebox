# SavantAppSqueezebox
Not perfect, but functional for the moment.

This is a simple workaround to enable squeezebox lmq with the new savant app.

Replace the existing profile with the squeezebox_player.xml and reconnect making sure to add the mac address and the logitech media server address.

An unfortunate side effect of this workaround is that the squeezebox will now look like an apple tv on both apps.

That said, it will work with any exisiting squeezebox setup including fusion music streamers.
